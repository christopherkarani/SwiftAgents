# Why Swarm

Most agent frameworks are Python-first, stringly-typed, and assume every workflow completes in one shot. Swarm makes different bets.

## Data Races Are Compile Errors

Swift 6.2's `StrictConcurrency` is enabled across every Swarm target — agents, memory, workflows, macros, and tests. Non-`Sendable` types crossing actor boundaries is a **build failure**, not a runtime crash.

```swift
// ❌ Compile error — caught before it ships
struct BrokenAgent: AgentRuntime {
    var cache: NSCache<NSString, NSString>
    // error: stored property 'cache' of 'Sendable'-conforming struct
    //        has non-Sendable type 'NSCache<NSString, NSString>'
}

// ✓ Actor isolation makes shared state safe
actor ResponseCache {
    private var store: [String: String] = [:]
    func set(_ value: String, for key: String) { store[key] = value }
    func get(_ key: String) -> String? { store[key] }
}
```

## Workflows Survive Crashes

Advanced workflows can use Swarm's durable checkpointing. You can persist state, then resume from a checkpoint ID without restarting from the beginning.

```swift
let result = try await Workflow()
    .step(fetchAgent)
    .step(analyzeAgent)
    .durable
    .checkpoint(id: "weekly-report", policy: .everyStep)
    .durable
    .checkpointing(.fileSystem(directory: checkpointsURL))
    .durable
    .execute("Create this week report")
```

A mid-step crash re-runs that whole step; side effects must be idempotent.
See [Durable Execution](./durable-execution.md) for signature stability and
checkpoint pruning.

## Workflow Is Fluent

Compose sequential, parallel, and routed flows with a small default API:

```swift
let result = try await Workflow()
    .step(fetchAgent)
    .parallel([bullAgent, bearAgent])
    .route { input in input.contains("risk") ? riskAgent : summaryAgent }
    .run("Analyze this quarter")
```

## Job Shares Notes

`Workflow` is the last-answer chain. `Job` is for shared notes and helpers
that each get a different brief.

| Need | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Last agent's answer becomes the next agent's input | `Workflow` |
| Shared notes, different briefs, N decided after a step | `Job` |

```swift
let sections = try await Job().run("Write an essay about rivers") { session in
    await session.ingest(JobRecord(kind: "note", text: "alpha: source"))
    await session.ingest(JobRecord(kind: "note", text: "beta: mouth"))
    let alpha = await session.window(query: "alpha", tokenLimit: 400)
    let beta = await session.window(query: "beta", tokenLimit: 400)
    return try await session.fanOut([
        JobChild(name: "alpha", agent: writerA, brief: alpha),
        JobChild(name: "beta", agent: writerB, brief: beta),
    ])
}
```

`JobStore` holds records. `JobSession.window` does the search.

## On-Device and Cloud — Same API

Apple Foundation Models built in. Custom backends implement `InferenceProvider` and drop in without changing the agent loop.

## Built for Apple Platforms

Native `AsyncThrowingStream` streaming, SwiftData persistence, Accelerate-backed vector memory, OSLog tracing. Swarm is Swift-native, not a Python port.
